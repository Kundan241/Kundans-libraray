        <div><h1 class="section-header">border box in css</h1></div>
       <small>21/06/2023</small>
       <p>In CSS, the border-box is a value for the box-sizing property that affects how the width and height of an element are calculated.

        By default, when you set the width and height of an element in CSS, those values do not include the padding and border of the element. This means that the final dimensions of the element will be larger than the specified width and height, as the padding and border will be added to the total size......</p>

       <small>21/06/2023</small>
       <p>The innerHTML and innerText properties are both used to manipulate the content of HTML elements in JavaScript, but they have some differences in how they work:

        innerHTML: This property allows you to get or set the HTML content inside an element. It returns a string that represents the HTML markup contained within the element, including any HTML tags and their content. When setting the innerHTML, you can provide valid HTML markup that will be parsed and rendered within the element.......</p>
